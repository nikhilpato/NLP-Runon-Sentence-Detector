# NLP Runon Sentence Detector

In this project, me and my partners (Mikey Maramba and Tyler Campanile) attempted to create a program that would automatically detect run on sentences.  The theory behind this detection was to use the Standord NLP Parser to see if there was a statistically significant parse of the input sentence that we could use to determine if the sentence was a runon.
